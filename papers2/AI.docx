AI-Powered Security Monitoring: A Technical Whitepaper
1. Abstract
This whitepaper presents an AI-powered cybersecurity monitoring platform that integrates machine learning, predictive analytics, and NLP-driven threat intelligence into traditional security workflows. Unlike existing Security Onion-based systems, this approach leverages PCAP importation to analyze historical network traffic, providing AI-driven threat detection, risk scoring, and predictive attack forecasting.
2. Introduction
2.1 Background
Cybersecurity threats are evolving rapidly, demanding real-time detection and proactive mitigation. Traditional Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solutions rely on signature-based threat detection, which struggles against zero-day attacks and adversarial tactics. This research aims to integrate AI-driven analytics into a Security Onion-like architecture to enhance cyber threat detection.
