Abstract: Our Approach in Enhancing Existing Cyber Threat Intelligence Technology
In the evolving cybersecurity landscape, traditional threat intelligence platforms often rely on passive data collection from known sources, which delays the detection of emerging threats. Our AI-Powered Cyber Threat Intelligence Platform enhances existing technologies by integrating advanced machine learning models, data collection from unconventional sources, and predictive analytics. 
Additionally, we leverage natural language processing (NLP), specifically transformer-based models like BERT.
A unique feature of our approach is predictive threat analytics using time-series models such as ARIMA and LSTM, which forecast potential threats based on historical attack patterns. This allows organizations to anticipate future risks, providing valuable time for mitigation strategies.
The platform also implements AI-driven prioritization and risk scoring, automatically ranking threats based on their potential impact on the organization. The interactive dashboard visualizes these threats in real time, offering an intuitive representation of attack patterns and suggested mitigations.
By combining real-time threat intelligence, AI-driven analysis, and predictive capabilities, our platform offers a proactive, scalable, and precise cybersecurity solution that surpasses traditional threat intelligence platforms.
