Detailed Project Report (DPR): AI-Powered Cybersecurity Monitoring System
1. Executive Summary
1.1 Project Title
AI-Powered Security Monitoring System for PCAP-Based Threat Intelligence
1.2 Project Overview
This project aims to develop an AI-driven cybersecurity monitoring platform that processes PCAP files to detect, analyze, and predict cyber threats. By integrating machine learning, predictive analytics, and NLP-based threat intelligence, this system enhances traditional Intrusion Detection and Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solutions.
1.3 Objectives
•	Develop a virtual machine (VM)-based deployment for easy setup.
•	Implement PCAP-based analysis to identify cyber threats.
•	Integrate AI models for threat intelligence extraction, predictive analytics, and automated risk scoring.
•	Build an interactive SOC dashboard for real-time security insights.

2. Project Justification
2.1 Problem Statement
Traditional cybersecurity monitoring tools rely on signature-based detection, which struggles against zero-day attacks and evolving adversarial tactics. Current Security Onion implementations provide strong network monitoring capabilities, but lack AI-enhanced threat intelligence.
2.2 Proposed Solution
By integrating AI-powered analysis into a Security Onion-like architecture, this project aims to process historical network traffic (PCAP files) and detect cyber threats proactively.
