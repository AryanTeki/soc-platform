AI-Powered Security Onion - VM-Based Deployment Plan
1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose
This document provides a plan for deploying an AI-powered Security Onion alternative on a virtual machine (VM) to import network PCAPs and showcase AI-driven threat intelligence, predictive analytics, and risk scoring.
1.2 Scope
•	Install and configure a lightweight Security Onion alternative on a single VM.
•	Import and analyze PCAP files instead of live network traffic.
•	Demonstrate AI-powered threat intelligence extraction, risk scoring, and predictive analytics.
•	Deploy a simple SOC dashboard for visualizing attack data.
1.3 Target Audience
•	Cybersecurity Students & Researchers – To experiment with AI-driven threat intelligence.
•	Developers & Data Scientists – To implement machine learning techniques for cybersecurity.
•	Security Operations Analysts – To automate attack analysis and prioritization.

2. System Architecture
2.1 High-Level Components
1.	PCAP Import & Parsing
o	Tools: Zeek, Suricata
o	Function: Extracts metadata (IP, DNS, HTTP, SSL, Protocols, Attack Signatures, etc.).
2.	AI-Driven Threat Intelligence & Analysis
o	NLP-Based Threat Extraction – Uses BERT/RoBERTa to analyze OSINT sources and extract relevant cyber threat intelligence.
o	Predictive Analytics – Uses LSTM, ARIMA models to forecast future attack trends.
o	Risk Scoring System – Uses Random Forest, XGBoost, and Deep Learning Models to score threats based on severity and exploitability.
3.	Data Storage & Management
o	Elasticsearch – Stores indexed logs & AI insights.
o	MongoDB/PostgreSQL – Stores structured metadata for deeper analysis.
4.	SOC Dashboard
o	Framework: React.js + Kibana + D3.js (for visualizations)
o	Function: Displays AI insights, attack paths, and risk scores.
