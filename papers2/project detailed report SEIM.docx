Project Detailed Report (DPR) for Developer: AI-Driven Cyber Threat Intelligence Platform
________________________________________
1. Overview
This project aims to develop an AI-Driven Cyber Threat Intelligence Platform to detect, analyze, and predict cyber threats in real-time. The platform will collect, process, and analyze threat data from diverse sources such as open threat feeds, dark web monitoring, and social media scraping. Using AI and machine learning (ML) models, the platform will identify emerging threats, forecast future cyberattacks, and provide actionable insights to help organizations mitigate risks.
The platform should be fully automated, scalable, and customizable, offering real-time visual analytics and predictive threat intelligence. It should allow security teams to stay ahead of evolving cyber threats and proactively protect their infrastructure.

2. Core Features and Requirements
2.1 Data Collection
•	Sources of Threat Intelligence:
o	Threat Feeds:
	Integrate open-source threat intelligence platforms (e.g., OTX, VirusTotal) to collect feeds of known indicators of compromise (IOCs), such as IPs, domains, and hashes.
o	Dark Web Monitoring:
	Set up scraping tools to continuously monitor dark web forums and marketplaces for potential cybersecurity threats. The scraper should be capable of detecting discussions about vulnerabilities, exploits, or attack planning.
	Use APIs like DarkOwl, IntSights, or custom-built scraping solutions for extracting relevant data.
o	Social Media Monitoring:
	Implement social media scraping from platforms like Twitter, Reddit, and Discord. Use public APIs like Tweepy for Twitter and Pushshift for Reddit to gather early threat signals from these platforms.
	Extract threat-related keywords, such as mentions of hacking groups, zero-day exploits, or new vulnerabilities.
o	Internal Network Logs (Optional):
	Integrate with internal network systems, security appliances, and firewalls to fetch log data for threat analysis (e.g., Syslog, Snort, Suricata logs).
2.2 Data Preprocessing
•	Data Cleaning:
o	Preprocess raw data to remove duplicates, irrelevant content, and noise. Apply basic data sanitization techniques to ensure all collected data is usable for further analysis.
•	Text Preprocessing (for NLP):
o	Apply tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and stop word removal on text data for NLP models.
o	Identify and extract key information like threat actor names, attack techniques, and vulnerabilities mentioned in scraped text.
2.3 Threat Detection and Analysis
•	Natural Language Processing (NLP):
o	BERT or similar transformer-based models should be used for contextual threat analysis from unstructured textual data (e.g., blogs, social media posts).
o	The NLP model should be trained to identify and classify threats based on keywords, techniques (e.g., MITRE ATT&CK), and attack scenarios.
o	Sentiment analysis on threat actor discussions to understand the intent behind cyber threats.
•	Threat Classification:
o	Categorize threats into categories (e.g., malware, phishing, ransomware, DDoS attacks).
o	Implement a custom classification model that can automatically assign threats to predefined categories based on context.
2.4 Predictive Analytics
•	Time-Series Forecasting:
o	Implement ARIMA and LSTM models to analyze historical attack data and predict future attack trends.
o	The system should use historical incident data to forecast likely attack types, intensities, and timeframes, providing early warning to security teams.
•	Anomaly Detection:
o	Use Isolation Forest, DBSCAN, or One-Class SVM for anomaly detection in threat data (i.e., identifying outliers in attack patterns).
2.5 Risk Scoring and Prioritization
•	Risk Scoring Mechanism:
o	Implement an AI model to assign a risk score to each detected threat, considering the threat’s severity, attack vector, and potential impact on the organization.
o	The model should also take into account real-time data such as whether a threat is being actively discussed on the dark web or social media.
•	Priority Alerts:
o	Automatically prioritize high-risk threats (e.g., ransomware, zero-day exploits) for immediate attention and response.
2.6 Dashboard and Visualization
•	Real-Time Threat Feed:
o	A live threat feed that continuously updates with incoming data, visualizing ongoing threats and trends.
•	Threat Visualizations:
o	Geographical mapping of threats to visualize attack sources, targets, and attack vectors.
o	Temporal analysis to visualize when certain attack types are most likely to occur (e.g., time of day, week, month).
o	Trend analysis to display the frequency of threats over time and identify emerging attack patterns.
•	Threat Timeline:
o	Visualize the progression of specific threats or attack campaigns over time.
•	Customizable Dashboards:
o	Users should be able to customize the dashboard based on their needs (e.g., add/remove widgets for different threat types, regions, or severity levels).
•	Real-Time Alerts:
o	Send automated, real-time notifications (via email or SMS) when high-risk threats are detected. Implement integration with Twilio for SMS alerts and SendGrid for email notifications.
2.7 Automated Mitigation Recommendations
•	Mitigation Action Suggestions:
o	For each identified threat, provide AI-driven mitigation suggestions based on the threat’s characteristics. This may include steps like:
	Patching specific vulnerabilities
	Isolating infected systems
	Blocking IPs or domains
	Disabling user accounts
•	Integration with SIEMs (Optional):
o	Provide an option to integrate with existing Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools (e.g., Splunk, ELK stack) to automate response actions based on threat intelligence.

4. Conclusion
This AI-driven Cyber Threat Intelligence Platform should be designed with scalability, modularity, and automation at its core. It should efficiently handle large volumes of data, provide real-time insights, and use advanced AI/ML models to enhance cyber threat detection and prediction. By integrating multiple data sources, implementing predictive analytics, and providing actionable insights, this platform aims to be a comprehensive solution for proactive cybersecurity threat management.
The developer should ensure that the platform is built to handle high concurrency, provide a smooth user experience, and remain flexible to future expansions (e.g., adding more data sources or AI models).
